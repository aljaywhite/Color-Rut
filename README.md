# Color-Rut
Not sure where to start when it comes to choosing colors? Bored maybe? Create random color combinations until you find what fits your current project, or to save for later.


This project is something I fell into while learning/practicing with Javascript and Jquery. Probably not the most original idea, but I had a lot of fun and surpassed a few personal milestones working on it. Feedback is welcome. Enjoy!
